# ⚡ The Blackout Predictor
**Predicting UK Grid Stability using XGBoost & Prophet**

## 📌 Project Overview
Energy demand forecasting is critical for preventing blackouts and reducing costs. This project analyzes 24-hour energy consumption patterns to predict demand spikes.

## 🏗️ Project Structure
* `data/`: Contains raw energy consumption logs (Not on GitHub for privacy/size).
* `notebooks/`: EDA and Experimentation.
* `src/`: Production-ready training scripts.
* `models/`: Serialized ML models.

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Run the training script: `python src/train_model.py`
